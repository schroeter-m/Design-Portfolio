## Welcome to my Design Portfolio
My name is Matthew Schroeter and I am a third year Bioengineering Student at Northeastern University

My interests lie in robotics, bio-inspired design, mechanical design and 3D bio-printing

My current classes include: Mechanical Computation and Design (Finite Element Analysis), Bioelectricity (Fundamentals of Circuits and Sensors)

### Work Experience
My previous internship took place at a Biotech startup called CATALOG. The company is building the world's first DNA-based platform for massive digital data storage and computation.
